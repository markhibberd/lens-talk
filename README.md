=========

This is the code for my talk, _Lens from the ground up_.

The slides are available at <https://speakerdeck.com/markhibberd/lens-from-the-ground-up>.

To follow along, I basically worked through the code and examples in [script.org](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markhibberd/lens-talk/master/script.org).

The most interesting pieces of code are:
 - The basic _van Laarhoven lens_ implementation: [Van.hs](https://github.com/markhibberd/lens-talk/blob/master/src/Van.hs)
 - The JavaScript refactoring tool: [Js.hs](https://github.com/markhibberd/lens-talk/blob/master/src/Js.hs)
